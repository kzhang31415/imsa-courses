# imsa-courses

A website which compiles information on course offerings at my high school, IMSA, into a more efficient and navigable format. This information was sourced from the Course Catalog found at https://imsa.edu/academics/academic-programs/. Information can be updated to remain accurate over time by teachers and administrators directly from the website.
